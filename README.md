# Vencord (Sqaaakoi's personal fork)

The cutest Discord client mod, now with extra silly stuff

For more information about Vencord, see the **[upstream README](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/README.md)**

# WARNING WARNING WARNING
### Everything is being fixed and/or reimplemented at the moment. Not everything you see below is included at the moment.

## Features

This is a list of features in this fork.

## My plugins
-   AutoMute
    -   Automatically mute yourself if you're silent for too long
-   BetterQuickReact (PR submitted to upstream)
    -   Customise the emoji grid size visible in the message context menu
    -   Sort by frequently used instead of favourites first (originally developed by Vee)
-   ContextMenuSelectFix
    -   Allows you to hold right click to open a context menu and then drag your mouse to the item and release to click it
-   ReactCommandReplyFix
    -   Fixes the +:emoji: built-in command to add the emoji to the message you are replying to
-   MoreJumboEmoji
    -   Customise the limit of jumbo emojis!
-   MoreGuildDiscoveryCategories
    -   Adds the non-primary categories to the guild discovery sidebar
-   CSS Snippets
    -   Core feature; similar to Quick CSS but easier to manage multiple snippets of CSS
-   NoDraftLengthLimit
    -   Removes the ~4500 character limit for saved draft messages.
-   ResizableSidebar
    -   Resize the sidebar on the left of your screen.
    -   Right click the invisible handle to reset it.
## My unmaintained plugins
-   VoiceChannelLog (work in progress)
    -   Adds a log for voice channel join/leave/move events.
-   VoiceJoinMessages (work in progress)
    -   Sends you notifications from your friends' DMs when they join a voice channel.
    -   Helpful if you forget to check in and see if your friends are all online in VC.
    -   Useful in case someone wants to talk to you in person and you forgot to mute.
-   ModViewBypass
    -   Allows you to view the experimental Guild Member Mod View sidebar menu without moderator permissions
    -   Useful for telling if someone is a troll who joined and forgot about the guild for months.
    -   A PR was submitted to upstream, however it was closed as functionality was added to the ShowHiddenThings plugin. You should probably use that instead.

<details>
<summary>Using Vencord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Vencord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Vencord in a server where you might get banned for it

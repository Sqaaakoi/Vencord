**ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for using Sqaaakoi's Vencord fork!**

Many new plugins have been made and many existing plugins have been updated recently. Here's a showcase.

**NewPluginsManager** shows a popup when plugins are added.
The plugin is enabled by default, you can disable it if you find it annoying.
Make sure to click Continue to completely dismiss it, this is intentional design.

**AutoMute** now has options to automatically mute when someone who isn't a friend joins your voice channel.

Additionally, **AskMeToMute** has been added so your admin friends can server mute you and it will turn into a client-side mute.

For those people who often create servers, **ServerTemplatesList** inserts templates from all your servers into the server creation menu.

Regardind plugins that haven't been added back, I either forgot about them, or didn't use them enough to bother fixing them.
Some of these will be remade soon:tm:

That's all for now. Take a look at https://github.com/users/Sqaaakoi/projects/3/views/1 to see what plugins I am making.

If any of my plugins have an issue, please file the issue at https://github.com/Sqaaakoi/Vencord/issues

${F`Thank you, friends! If you have feedback on these plugins, please DM me :)`}
